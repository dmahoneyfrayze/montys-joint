# SEO Pillar Page Operating Model & Strategy

**Goal:** Use pillar pages as permanent authority assets, not campaign pages.

## 1. The Core Mental Model
The pillar is **not** a promo page, ranking trick, or ad.
The pillar **is**:
*   The local category homepage for Google.
*   A gravity well that pulls authority from blogs, menus, and GBP.
*   A stable URL that compounds trust over time.

## 2. Fixed URL, Evolving Content
*   **Rule:** Never change the URL.
*   **Evolve:** Sections, internal links, FAQs, reviews, photos, freshness signals.
*   **Constant:** Purpose, topic, core positioning.

## 3. Internal Link Hub
Every new piece of content must feed into the pillar.
*   **New Blog:** Link to relevant pillar.
*   **Seasonal Promo:** Link to relevant pillar.
*   **Menu Update:** Link to pillar.
*   **Rule:** No blog or promo should live alone. The pillar keeps authority centralized.

## 4. Absorbing Volatility
Pillars stabilize rankings while blogs/promos rise and fall. Consistent updates make it hard to displace.

## 5. E-E-A-T Ledger
Continuously add signals of Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trust without rewriting the whole page.
*   **Quarterly:** Add 1-2 FAQs, update review counts, swap photos, link new blogs.
*   **Annually:** Refresh intro, add "What's new this year", update schema timestamps.

## 6. Pillar + GBP (Google Business Profile)
*   Reference the pillar in GBP Posts and About section.
*   Use pillar as the destination for discovery searches.
*   GBP captures map intent; Pillar captures search intent.

## 7. Future-Proofing
Maintained, trusted pillars are sources for AI summaries. They become the "local expert" citation source.

## 8. What NOT To Do
*   Do not rewrite constantly.
*   Do not over-optimize anchors.
*   Do not stuff "best" everywhere.
*   Do not add fake comparisons.
*   Do not turn it into a sales page.

## 9. Maintenance Cadence
*   **Monthly:** Add 1 internal link from new content.
*   **Quarterly:** Small content refresh (5–10 mins).
*   **Annually:** Light rewrite + freshness update.

## 10. Reality Check
Top restaurants rank for "best restaurants + city" because they claim the category they belong to. This is legitimate "first-party" authority.
